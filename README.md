# Acid Piano
This project implements a virtual piano whose some keys represents the 7 musical natual notes [C, D, E, F, G, A, B].
Using the bios speaker to reproduce its frequencies. 
NOTE: I did not use any compiler for assembly but rather the good and old debug.exe in MS-DOS.
Current versions of windows do not have it, so if you would like to run the program, you must run debug.exe inside DOSBox
